# Basic Cubes

The image below shows the various base cube designs. These are as follows:
  * The cube with no sides cut out can be used as a filler cube, for example if you need an extra cube to use with an attachment for another part or piece of equipment. For example we use one of these when using the adapter for the OpenFlexure microscope.
  * The cube with one side cut out can be used as an end cube in a system.
  * There are two different designs for cubes with two sides cut out. One has opposite walls cut out and can be used in the middle of an optical path. The other has adjacent sides cut out and can be used as a corner cube, for example to hold a dichroic mirror.
