# OpenFlexure Stage Adapter

The OpenFlexure stage is a 3D printable 3 axis control microscope stage (https://openflexure.org/projects/microscope/) developed by the Bath Open INstrumentation Group. In order to make this stage compatible with our modular cube system, we have developed an adapter that lets the stage attach to our cubes through the jigsaw lid system. This adapter also replaces the "feet" on the OpenFlexure Stage by providing a bar for each axis which the elastic band can wrap around instead of the standard feet, which allows a flush fit to our cubes.

We print this with 0.15mm layer height and 80% and higher infill. Support material is also required for the elastic band bars, this can either be standard PLA or PVA. It is best to print this piece with the jigsaw system facing up.
