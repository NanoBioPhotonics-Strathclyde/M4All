# Raspberry Pi Holders

These are 3D printed cases for Raspberry Pi's which can be screwed down onto an optical bench or other surface to stop them moving about. So far I have only designed one to hold three Raspberry Pi Zero W's to be used with a three channel system where three Raspberry Pi Cameras are required. This can be printed with 0.2mm layer height and 50% or greater infill.

## Raspberry Pi Zero Case and Base

The case and base for three Raspberry Pi Zero W's are shown below. The case part has all the cut outs needed to access all the ports on the Pi. The base has two rectangular cut outs to allow it to be secured to an optical bench with M6 screws. The case attaches to the base through a jigsaw system. If there is tension on the Raspberry Pi cables, the parts may pop out from one another and so a crude solution is to tape the case to the base. This case should prevent the Pi's being damaged from any static electricity.
