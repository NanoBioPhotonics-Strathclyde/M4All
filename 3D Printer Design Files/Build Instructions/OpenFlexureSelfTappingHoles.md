# OpenFlexure Self Tapping Holes

The Bath Open INstrumentation Group designed a test piece with varying sizes of self tapping trylinder holes (https://gist.github.com/rwb27/9c3ac259831a2d4316a7ae65a9f460fc). These are used on the OpenFlexure microscope for attaching the stepper motors to the actuators. We thought these were very useful and so used the STL file for the test piece to extract FreeCAD sketches of each of the hole sizes. We have used these sketches to create self tapping holes on a number of our designs.
