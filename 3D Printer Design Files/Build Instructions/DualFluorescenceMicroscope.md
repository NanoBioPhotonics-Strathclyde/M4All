# Dual Fluorescence Channel Microscope

This section of the FreeCAD file includes designs where we have placed the individual cube designs together to create larger parts for 3D printing. These designs are specifically for parts for a dual fluorescence channel microscope. The wavelength ranges of the detection channels can be chosen by the user by selecting specific dichroic mirrors.
