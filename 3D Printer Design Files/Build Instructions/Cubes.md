# Cubes

## Basic Cubes

The image below shows the various cube designs under "Basic Cubes". These are as follows:
  * The cube with no sides cut out can be used as a filler cube, for example if you need an extra cube to use with an attachment for another part or piece of equipment. For example we use one of these when using the adapter for the OpenFlexure microscope.
  * The cube with one side cut out can be used as an end cube in a system.
  * There are two different designs for cubes with two sides cut out. One has opposite walls cut out and can be used in the middle of an optical path. The other has adjacent sides cut out and can be used as a corner cube, for example to hold a turning mirror.
  * Then there is one with three walls and one with all four walls cut out to allow junctions between branches.
  * Finally we have provided one where the end wall has a slot for a raspberry pi camera cable.

## Open Ended Cubes

The next section is "Open Ended Cubes". These can be used in the case where you need a cube with a length larger than 50mm. For example if an optical element needs to sit where a wall would be positioned or if you need to be able to slide elements back and forth. There are two open ended cube designs:
  * The first has one side open ended. You can join two of these together to create a 100mm long cube.
  * The second has both sides open ended so if you require longer than 100mm then you can place as many of these in the middle of two single open ended cubes as required.

## 25mm x 36mm Beamsplitter Cubes
  
The third section of cubes is "25mm x 36mm Beamsplitter Cubes". As 25mm x 36mm rectangular optics are not compatible with the 30mm cage system we have designed three different cube options for holding this size of optics:

Note: The current designs are to hold a plate thickness of 1mm, but this can be altered in FreeCAD.

1. **Beamsplitter Cube** has a plate holder that is monolithically printed inside the cube. Two bars can then be screwed in place using M3 screws to hold the optic in place. As the screws need to be screwed in through the holes in the cube walls, this part is only suitable if printed as a single cube and not joined to others where these walls would be blocked.
2. **Beamsplitter Cube001** is similar to the first option, however this design includes a plate locker that slides into two gaps on the bottom of the cube and screws onto the top of the plate. Therefore this cube can be joined to others and printed monolithically.
3. **Beamsplitter Cube002** has the plate holder separate from the cube. The cube includes a section where the plate holder can be inserted into and the same bars as in the first option are included for holding the optic in place.

It is recommended to print these with either support material or if using Cura to enable bridge settings. I have uploaded the settings file used for our Ultimaker S5 here...

For option 2, if you find that your optical element is not sitting completely vertical (e.g. if there is an angle to the reflected and transmitted beams), you can add shims to the inside of the plate locker by adding layers of electrical tape to either the top or bottom.

Option 3 has not yet been fully tested.

## Cube Lids

There are two screwless lids that fix onto the top of the cubes using a jigsaw system to allow a light tight optical setup. One is a lid that covers one full cube. The other is half a lid (split disgonally) to cover half a cube. This second option is to fit with the second option OpenFlexure stage adapter (see build instructions).
