# Inserts

The orientation of the inserts in FreeCAD are the recommended printing orientation.

## 45 Degree Mirror Holder

This part holds a 1 inch mirror with thickness 6mm at 45 degrees. This can be hung from the cage system rods in two different orientations. The first orientation is to reflect a beam coming vertically down into cubes by 45 degrees so that it can travel horizontally around the cube system. This is useful for sample stages that sit above the cubes. The second orientation allows beams to be turned inside the cube system.

The radius and thickness of the cylinder to hold the mirror can be altered in FreeCAD if different sized mirrors are required. Expanding the "Inserts" folder in the tree view on FreeCAD will then allow you to expand the body design "45 Degree Mirror Holder". Editing the "Mirror Hole" sketch will allow you to alter the radius. Editing the "Mirror Hole Pocket" will allow you to alter the thickness.

## 1 Inch Dichroic Holder

This part is similar to the mirror holder however it has channels to allow the transmitted beam to pass through the insert. It has been designed for a dichroic thickness of 3mm. There is also a plate to lock the dichroic in place with M3 screws. This part can also be used for 1 inch beamsplitters.

Again the dimensions of the part can be altered in FreeCAD if different sized optics are required in the same way as above.

## Raspberry Pi Camera v2 Holder

This part has a slight indent for the camera module to fit into with a gap at the back for space for the electronics. There are 4 screw holes to hold the camera module in place with nuts at the back. The insert also has a cut out at the top for the camera cable. On the top of the insert there are self tapping M3 screw holes to provide some friction between the insert and the rods to hold it in place.






4. **1 Inch Lens Holder** will fit various thicknesses of 1 inch lenses which can be held in place with the retaining ring design. If a greater thickness is required the FreeCAD design can be modified. The top of the insert again has screw holes to hole the insert in place on the metal rods.
